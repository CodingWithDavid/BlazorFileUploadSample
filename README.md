# Blazor Components

This project was created to help me learn about uploading files to the server, playing with memory streams and writing to the server folder structure in a Blazor Application.

## Why

This post is my implementation of Steveâ€™s InputFile component.  For a detail description of the inner workings of the component see the link above.  I will be using the Server Configuration for my Blazor Application, but the component will work with any Blazor configuration.  Please note that the implementation to save the uploaded file to the server is for only the Server configuration.  For the Client configuration you would need a Server End point.

With the InputFIle component you can upload any file type.  For the displaying the uploaded file we will be supporting only images and text files.  There are of course components for PDFs and office files. Available but that is beyond what are trying to achieve.
